### DESCRIPTION
This project is an RPG game with a Star Wars theme. The project uses objects and jQuery as basic tool to 
manage the logic of displaying diferent characters based on the user inputs.


#INSTRUCTIONS:
- The objective of the game is to defeat all characters other than the one ou pick to play as.
    + You WIN a game if you defeat all characters.
    + You LOOSE the game if a character deafeat your character.

- Every character has a starting `health points` level (HP), an `attack power` and a `counter attack power`... the
  amount of the last two are not obvious. So you need to strategize.

- First select the character you want to play as

- Second select the character you want to attack.

- Click the "Attack!" button to make an attack.

- Once you atack an oponent, your `HP` will diminish by the other character's `counter attack power`. However its
  `HP` will diminish by your player `attack power`... this will increase every time there is an attack.


# TIPS
